# Plain Mental Health App - System Design Document

## Implementation Approach

We will build Plain as a modern web application using React/TypeScript with Shadcn-ui components and Tailwind CSS for styling. The architecture follows a microservices approach with a RESTful API backend, PostgreSQL database, and integrated third-party services for payments and email delivery.

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
2. **UI Library**: Shadcn-ui with Radix UI primitives for accessible, customizable components
3. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and responsive design
4. **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API services
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data with Redis for caching and sessions
6. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
7. **Payment Processing**: Intasend API integration for Nigerian market
8. **Email Service**: SendGrid for transactional emails and AI-generated reports
9. **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for generating personalized recommendations
10. **Deployment**: Docker containers with cloud hosting (AWS/Digital Ocean)

### Architecture Patterns:
- **MVC Pattern**: Clear separation of concerns between models, views, and controllers
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction layer
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Business logic encapsulation
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time updates and notifications
- **Strategy Pattern**: AI agent personality implementation (Dan/Jemma)

- Request rate limiting per user/IP
- API versioning for backward compatibility
- Request/response logging for audit trails
- Error handling without sensitive data exposure

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Optimization:
- Code splitting and lazy loading of components
- Image optimization with Cloudinary
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Service worker for offline capabilities
- Bundle size optimization with tree shaking

### Backend Optimization:
- Database query optimization with indexes
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Connection pooling for database connections
- Pagination for large data sets
- Background job processing for email generation

### Scalability:
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers

## Anything UNCLEAR

Several aspects require clarification for optimal implementation:

1. **AI Agent Personalities**: Specific personality traits, communication styles, and expertise areas for Dan and Jemma need detailed definition for consistent AI-generated content.

2. **Email Frequency Customization**: Beyond weekly/daily reports, should users have granular control over email timing, triggers, and content preferences?

3. **Data Retention Policy**: Specific requirements for data retention periods, backup strategies, and user data deletion procedures need clarification.

4. **Integration Roadmap**: Future plans for integrating with actual device usage data, calendar apps, or productivity tools should inform current architecture decisions.

5. **Scalability Requirements**: Expected user growth trajectory and concurrent user limits will impact infrastructure planning and database optimization strategies.

6. **Nigerian Market Localization**: Requirements for local language support, currency handling, and integration with local mental health resources need specification.

7. **Offline Capabilities**: Extent of offline functionality required - should users be able to track time and sync later, or is real-time connectivity mandatory?

8. **Compliance Requirements**: Specific data protection regulations beyond GDPR that apply to the Nigerian market and healthcare data handling.

These clarifications will help refine the architecture and ensure the system meets all business and technical requirements effectively.
